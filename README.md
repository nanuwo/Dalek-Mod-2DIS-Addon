# Dalek-Mod-2DIS-Addon
Adds back the 2Dis to the Dalek Mod!

Features:
- 2Dis item, right click living entities to make them 2D and shift right click to unflatten yourself
- Entities will return to normal dimensions after a period of three minutes
- You can hurt entities by landing on them in the TARDIS (doesn't make them appear flat because it's annoying)
- 2D entities are unharmed by TARDIS squishing
